title: Open Music Theory
---

This is a fork of Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley, *Open Music Theory*, [Hybrid Pedagogy](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/) 2014+.
This version is for test purposes, exploring adapting OER text for the classroom.
Thanks to everyone who worked on the original!

**Open Music Theory** is an open-source, interactive, online "text"book for college-level music theory courses. OMT was built on resources authored by Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley. It is edited by Kris Shaffer and Robin Wharton, and is published by [Hybrid Pedagogy Publishing](http://www.hybridpedagogy.org/#publishing). 

Major funding and technological support (including the building of the technology behind the interactive music notation modules found in this text) came from the team at [Trinket](http://www.trinket.io).

The first major edition of OMT was made possible financially by [a crowdfunding campaign](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/page-two/open-interactive-music-theory-textbook-campaign-update/) in the summer of 2014. Many thanks to the donors who supported the project (listed on the [about](about.html) page).
