# Open Music Theory OER

This is a fork of Kris Shaffer, Bryn Hughes, and Brian Moseley, *Open Music Theory*, [Hybrid Pedagogy](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/) 2014+.
This version is for test purposes, exploring adapting OER text for the classroom.
Thanks to everyone who worked on the original!
